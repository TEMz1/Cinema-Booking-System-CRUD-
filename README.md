**Introduction this repository**

Welcome to the Cinema Booking System repository! This project is built using PHP Native and includes key features such as PHPMailer for email handling and Midtrans as the payment gateway.

**Key Features:**
1. User Authentication & Email Verification:
   ‚Ä¢ PHPMailer is utilized to send email verification links upon user registration.<br>
   ‚Ä¢ Users can also request password reset emails if they forget their credentials.

2. Secure Online Payment with Midtrans:

   ‚Ä¢ The system integrates Midtrans payment gateway to facilitate secure and seamless transactions for   ticket bookings.<br>
   ‚Ä¢ Once the payment is successfully processed, the system automatically generates a PDF ticket containing a QR Code, which is sent to the user‚Äôs registered email via PHPMailer.

3. QR Code Scanning for Ticket Validation:
   ‚Ä¢ At the cinema counter, clerks can scan the QR Code on the ticket to verify its authenticity and grant access to the customer.<br>
   ‚Ä¢ This ensures a fast and efficient check-in process for moviegoers.

This project is designed to provide a smooth, secure, and efficient movie ticket booking experience, combining the power of PHP Native, PHPMailer, and Midtrans.

Feel free to explore the repository, contribute, or modify the system according to your needs! üöÄüé¨
